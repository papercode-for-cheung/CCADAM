## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

**CCADAM-DDIE** is a contrastive learning framework designed to enhance the stability of DDIE prediction by dynamically adjusting molecular substructure topologies and contrastive learning with core substructure.

This repository contains the publicly available implementations and datasets of CCADAM-DDIE.
